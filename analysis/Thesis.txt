Chapter One: Introduction
Executive summary
This research examines corporate governance challenges in Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector, focusing on systemic failures that elevate default risk and undermine financial stability, critical for economic growth. Governance deficiencies, rooted in historical legacies and intensified post-2004 consolidation, manifest as weak accountability and transparency, threatening stakeholder trust and systemic resilience. The research identifies key issues: regulatory multiplicity, unqualified management, inadequate risk management, and ineffective governance structures, which collectively drive bank failures, with 425 recorded since 1988.
A fragmented regulatory framework—comprising conflicting codes like CAMA 2020, NCCG 2018, CBN Guidelines 2023, and SEC Code 2011—creates ambiguity, enabling banks to evade rigorous standards. Weak enforcement by regulators, such as the CBN and FRCN, exacerbates non-compliance. Unqualified or politically motivated management appointments, often lacking financial expertise, compromise oversight and ethical compliance, while concentrated ownership and the absence of independent nomination committees in 61% of banks entrench management self-interest. Inadequate risk management, evidenced by non-performing loans reaching 20% in 2017 against a 5% threshold, further heightens default risk. Audit committees and boards, critical for transparency, lack independence, undermining financial reporting accuracy.
This research evaluates these governance failures’ impact on default risk. It advocates for a harmonized regulatory framework, independent nomination committees, performance-linked compensation, and robust whistleblowing mechanisms to enhance accountability and transparency. 
Addressing these challenges, the research aims to restore stakeholder confidence, reduce default risk, and strengthen Nigeria’s banking sector, aligning it with global standards. Its significance lies in filling a research gap with context-specific insights, informing policy reforms, and safeguarding an industry pivotal to Nigeria’s economy, paving the way for sustainable governance solutions based on 2024 data. The 2009–2010 Nigerian banking crisis saw non-performing loan (NPL) ratios exceed 35% across the sector, though institutional variation ranged from 8% to 62% amid uniform macroeconomic pressures. This disparity underscores that internal governance factors, rather than external economic cycles alone, significantly contribute to concentrated credit losses. In addressing this, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced targeted reforms: Basel II implementation (2011), the Corporate Governance Code for Banks (2014), and IFRS-9 standards (2018). These initiatives emphasize three core governance indices: disclosure, practice, and compliance. However, empirical evidence on their collective or individual effects on NPL ratios remains limited, representing a key gap in understanding reform efficacy within Nigeria's post-crisis banking landscape.
This research bridges that gap by quantifying each index as a continuous governance variable in a balanced panel dataset spanning 2009–2024 for ten leading deposit money banks. Aligned with RQ1 and OB1, the analysis estimates the marginal NPL sensitivity to each index, evaluates structural shifts following the 2014 code's mandatory enforcement, and prioritizes indices by impact magnitude, controlling for bank size, capital adequacy, and macroeconomic factors. The primary hypothesis (H1) posits that enhanced governance indices substantially lower NPL ratios, with practice yielding the most pronounced marginal benefit.
The study advances knowledge in four ways. First, it offers emerging-market insights showing that behavioural governance indices, beyond mere structural forms, shape credit risk outcomes. Second, split-regime models reveal that disclosure gains potency under enforceable mandates. Third, practice emerges as the most resilient NPL mitigator, supporting stewardship theory's emphasis on cultural elements over capital metrics. Fourth, a governance-focused policy framework shifts regulatory emphasis from aggregate capital ratios to index-specific behavioural indicators.
1.1 Corporate Governance Challenges in Nigeria’s Deposit Money Banking Sector
Corporate governance in Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector faces systemic challenges that undermine accountability, transparency, and financial stability, elevating bank default risks and threatening economic growth (King & Levine, 1993). These issues, rooted in historical legacies, persist in the post-2004 consolidation era, with cases like Oceanic Bank revealing insider dealings and financial misrepresentations tied to agency problems (Sanusi, 2009). Pre-colonial systems relied on customary laws, while colonial frameworks like the Companies Ordinance of 1912 imposed misaligned foreign. The historical legacy of Nigeria’s banking sector, spanning pre-colonial indigenous governance, colonial frameworks like the Companies Ordinance of 1912, and post-independence adaptations such as the Companies Act of 1968 and CAMA 2020, has fostered a fragmented governance system. 
This legacy, marked by government ownership pre-1986 and politically motivated board appointments, directly contributes to current issues like weak accountability, unqualified management, and regulatory ambiguity, amplifying default risk in the post-2004 consolidation era (Elias, 2024; Chinweoda et al., 2020; Sanusi, 2014).Risk management failures, with NPLs reaching 20% in 2017 against a 5% threshold, reflect lax lending and weak controls, fueling distress in banks like Intercontinental Bank (Adegboye, 2020). 
This contrasts with Basel III’s robust risk frameworks (BCBS, 2010). Fraud concealment, enabled by weak whistleblowing, persisted in the 2009 crisis, unlike the EU’s protected reporting channels (Olojede et al., 2020; EU, 2019). These deficiencies erode trust, trigger deposit withdrawals, and destabilize Nigeria’s economy, where banks are vital (Siyanbola, 2019). The 2009 crisis, requiring a $3.9 billion CBN intervention, highlighted systemic risks fromweak oversight and insider dealings (Sanusi, 2009). Globally, OECD principles emphasize independent boards and risk management, areas where Nigeria lags (OECD, 2015). 
This research investigates these issues in the Nigerian deposit money banking system, examining corporate governance indices (disclosure, practice, and compliance) against NPL ratios over 2009–2024 (RQ1), the mediating role of financial-reporting integrity in the association between audit-committee independence and NPL ratios in 2024 (RQ2), management qualifications (measured by banking experience and governance training from 2024 data) and NPL ratios (RQ3), and the clarity and enforcement consistency of regulatory frameworks (from 2024 questionnaire and interviews) and NPL ratios (RQ4). It aims to propose harmonized regulations, independent committees, and qualified management to align with global standards and reduce default risk (Efunniyi et al., 2024). By addressing historical legacies, regulatory conflicts, and governance gaps, it seeks to enhance financial stability and fill research gaps in Nigeria’s banking sector (Osita et al., 2019).
1.1.1 Corporate Governance Issues: Emphasis on Transparency and Accountability
Corporate governance in Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector is pivotal for ensuring financial stability, yet it faces systemic challenges that undermine transparency and accountability—two essential pillars for fostering trust and safeguarding stakeholder interests. Transparency ensures stakeholders have access to accurate, timely, and comprehensive information about a bank’s financial and operational performance, while accountability holds management and boards responsible for their actions, aligning their interests with those of shareholders and other stakeholders (Solomon, J., 2020; Healy & Palepu, 2001). In Nigeria, these principles are consistently eroded by deficiencies in board oversight, disclosure practices, stakeholder communication, audit controls, and executive compensation practices, leading to reduced investor trust, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and reputational damage, all of which contribute to heightened default risk. This chapter examines these issues within the Nigerian context, drawing on historical legacies, regulatory challenges, and specific cases like Oceanic Bank to highlight their impact, and proposes measures to strengthen governance and mitigate the risk of bank failures.
The board of directors, as the cornerstone of corporate governance, is responsible for overseeing management, setting strategic direction, and ensuring accountability to shareholders (Aguilera & Ruiz Castillo, 2025; OECD, 2023). However, in Nigeria’s banking sector, boards often lack the independence and effectiveness needed to fulfill these roles. Historical government interference, particularly before 1986, and post-independence political appointments have fostered a culture of cronyism, with boards frequently populated by unqualified or politically motivated members (Chinweoda, U. O., et al., 2020; Nwoko, U., et al., 2022). At Oceanic Bank, for example, the presence of family members such as Mrs. Ibru and Mr. Oboden Ibru on the board enabled insider loans, with over 75% of non-performing loans in 2009 linked to Ibru family-controlled companies, reflecting a severe lack of independent oversight (Sanusi, 2009). Compounding this issue, 61% of Nigerian banks lack independent nomination committees, allowing concentrated ownership to dominate appointments and prioritize management’s self-interest over stakeholders, as seen in the collapses of Intercontinental Bank and Bank PHB (Ogbechie, 2016; Owolabi, 2013). This lack of independence undermines the board’s ability to hold management accountable, leading to financial mismanagement and increased default risk.
Transparent disclosure and reporting practices are vital for stakeholders to assess a bank’s financial health, yet Nigerian banks frequently engage in financial misstatements and fail to provide timely information. Many banks deviate from proper accounting standards, exploiting regulatory multiplicity to adopt less stringent codes, which distorts their financial position (Babajibe et al., 2020; Osemeke, L., & Adegbite, 2016). During the 2009 banking crisis, for instance, weak oversight allowed banks like Oceanic Bank to conceal non-performing loans through inadequate reporting, delaying stakeholder awareness of financial distress (Olojede, P., et al., 2020). While the shift of Audit Committee reports from voluntary to mandatory has aimed to improve transparency, their effectiveness is often compromised when committees lackindependence, functioning at the behest of majority shareholders or management (Healy & Palepu, 2001; Adegbite, 2014). This opacity erodes investor confidence and increases the risk of bank failures, as stakeholders cannot accurately gauge the bank’s stability (Ugochukwu, 2000).
Effective governance also requires robust stakeholder communication and the protection of rights, particularly for minority shareholders, but Nigerian banks often exhibit opaque decision-making and neglect these groups. Management frequently prioritizes its own interests over those of shareholders, a classic agency problem exacerbated by weak board oversight (Osemeke, L., & Adegbite, 2016). In the case of Oceanic Bank, decisions on insider loans and asset transfers to shell companies were made without transparent communication to shareholders, marginalizing minority voices and eroding trust (Sanusi, 2009). Regulatory multiplicity further complicates this issue, as conflicting codes—such as the NCCG’s “Apply and Explain” flexibility versus the CBN’s stricter mandates—create ambiguity in enforcing shareholder rights (Abdulmalik, S. O., & Ahmad, A. C., 2020). The absence of robust whistleblowing mechanisms, a key factor in the 2009 crisis, also stifles stakeholders’ ability to report misconduct, further entrenching opacity in decision-making and undermining accountability (Olojede, P., et al., 2020).
Audit-committee independence and internal controls are critical for ensuring transparency in financial reporting and detecting mismanagement, but in Nigeria, these mechanisms are often weak and subject to external auditor conflicts. Audit-committee independence is undermined by majority shareholder influence on CAMA Section 359(4)’s mandate for equal representation of directors and shareholders (Adegbite,2014)(see figure 2 below). During the 2009 crisis, audit committees failed to rigorously review financial statements, allowing fraud and financial impropriety to go undetected (Olojede, P., et al., 2020). External auditor conflicts,similar to those seen in global cases like Enron where auditors faced constraints in investigating companyaffairs, are also prevalent in Nigeria, weakening the oversight of internal controls and allowing financial misstatements to persist (Mallin, 2010; Rezaee et al., 2003; Hossain, M., & Hou, Y., 2020). These deficiencies increase default risk by obscuring the true financial health of banks, particularly where financial-reporting integrity does not mediate the effect of audit-committee independence on NPL ratios.
Executive compensation structures, intended to align management’s interests with those of shareholders, often foster misaligned incentives and lack transparency in Nigeria’s banking sector. Regulatory multiplicity creates discrepancies in remuneration policies, with codes like the SEC Code of 2011 requiring shareholder approval for compensation, while the NCCG allows more flexibility, leading to inconsistent practices (Osemeke, L., & Adegbite,2016)(See Figure 2 below). At Oceanic Bank, undisclosed and excessive compensation to executives tied to the Ibru family facilitated insider dealings, prioritizing personal gain over shareholder interests (Sanusi, 2009). Such non-disclosure obscures accountability, as stakeholders cannot assess whether incentives drive ethical performance, while the lack of performance-linked compensation allows executives to face little consequence for mismanagement, further increasing the risk of financial distress (Al-Shaer, H., et al., 2022; Salehi, M., et al., 2023).
These governance issues have profound consequences for transparency and accountability in Nigeria’s banking sector. Opaque decision-making, financial misstatements, and non-disclosure of compensation reduce investor trust, leaving them unable to make informed decisions, as evidenced by mass deposit withdrawals following the 2009 crisis (Ugochukwu, 2000). Regulatory scrutiny intensifies as agencies like the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria (FRCN) struggle to enforce compliance amidst conflicting codes, with weak enforcement mechanisms failing to deter governance failures (Nwoke, U., et al., 2023; Adegbite, 2012). Reputational damage follows, as public backlash against governance lapses—similar to global cases like United Airlines in 2017—erodes stakeholder confidence and impacts banks’ market standing (Shepardson, 2017). Collectively,these issues heighten default risk, with 425 bank failures since 1988 underscoring the systemic consequences of governance deficiencies (Udo, B.,2020)(see Figure 1 below).
Addressing these challenges requires targeted measures to strengthen transparency and accountability. Boards must be made more independent by mandating nomination committees to ensure diverse, qualified, and impartial members, reducing the influence of concentrated ownership (Ogbechie, 2016; Fariha et al., 2022). Stricter enforcement of timely and accurate financial reporting, with audit committees empowered to operate independently, is essential to improve disclosure standards (Healy & Palepu, 2001; Al-Shaer, H., et al., 2022). Robust whistleblowing mechanisms and independent external audits can enhance internal controls, detecting and preventing financial impropriety (Olojede, P., et al., 2020; Rezaee et al., 2003). Aligning executive compensation with performance, coupled with mandatory disclosure of remuneration policies, ensures incentives drive ethical behavior and enhance transparency (Salehi, M., et al., 2023). Continuous monitoring through regular governance audits, stakeholder feedback, and regulatory harmonization is vital to sustain these reforms, aligning Nigeria’s banking sector with global best practices (Herbert, W. E., & Agwor, T. C., 2021; Beekes & Brown, 2006).
In conclusion, transparency and accountability are indispensable for effective corporate governance in Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector, yet they are consistently undermined by systemic issues in board oversight, disclosure practices, stakeholder communication, audit controls, and executive compensation. These deficiencies, rooted in historical legacies and exacerbated by regulatory multiplicity, have led to reduced investor trust, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and reputational damage, contributing to 425 bank failures since 1988 and persistent default risk (Udo, B., 2020; Kafidipe, 2021). Cases like Oceanic Bank illustrate how these governance failures—lacking independent oversight, concealing financial distress, and misaligning incentives—threaten financial stability and stakeholder confidence.
Implementing measures such as strengthening board independence, improving disclosure standards, enhancing internal controls, and aligning compensation with performance is critical to restoring trust and mitigating default risk. Ongoing monitoring and regulatory harmonization will ensure these reforms are sustainable, aligning Nigeria’s banking governance with global standards and supporting its role in economic growth (King & Levine, 1993; Siyanbola, 2019). This chapter sets the stage for further empirical analysis of these issues, as outlined in the research’s objectives and research questions.
1.1.2 Default Risk and Nigerian Banks
The Nigerian banking sector, particularly deposit money banks (DMBs), has faced recurrent defaults, exposing critical weaknesses in corporate governance, risk management, and regulatory oversight. These failures have destabilized the financial system, eroded stakeholder confidence, and required substantial government interventions. The causes of bank defaults inNigeria are multifaceted, stemming from a complex interplay of institutional, economic, political, supervisory, and regulatory inadequacies, as identified by Ogunleye (2002). A primary driver is weak corporate governance, marked by inadequate board oversight, lack of transparency, and poor management practices. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has highlighted inefficient, incompetent, and unstable management as a key factor in collapses, such as that of Savannah Bank, once a top 10 financial institution.
Governance failures often involve violations of best practices, including insider loans, unlawful credits, and transactions with shell companies controlled by bank insiders, amplifying moral hazard problems. Agency issues further heighten the risk of default. The principle-agent problem, first articulated by Adam Smith (1776), reveals how managers may prioritize self-interest over the institution’s survival, especially in banks with concentrated ownership structures. 
Fernando et al. (2019) note that companies with concentrated ownership show a higher correlation with default than those with distributed ownership, as managers misuse depositors’ funds through special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for unjust enrichment (Abubakar, 2011). This contributes to elevated non-performing loan (NPL) ratios, which reached 37% in 2009—far above the global average of 6.6% (Nwosu, 2020)—reflecting poor risk assessment and lending practices. Economic and market dynamics also play a role. Informational asymmetries in loan markets lead to adverse selection, where high interest rates attract riskier borrowers, reducing the quality of loan portfolios and bank earnings (Stiglitz, 1987; Bertrand et al., 2011; Mayer & Mereno, 2003). In competitive environments, banks may lower interest rates to attract customers, inadvertently drawing in poor-quality borrowers and further weakening loan portfolios (Admati & Hellwig, 2013). These factors, combined with a lack of financial expertise on boards and inadequate risk management, create a fertile ground for default.
Several high-profile cases illustrate the severity of bank defaults in Nigeria. Savannah Bank’s collapse, as noted by the CBN, was driven by managerial incompetence and instability, markinga significant loss for a once-prominent institution. In 2009, five major banks—Afribank, Finbank, Intercontinental Bank, Oceanic Bank, and Union Bank—holding 30% of Nigeria’s deposits, faced imminent failure. The CBN intervened with a $3.9 billion injection to stabilize these institutions, underscoring the systemic risk posed by their distress. Afribank, one of Africa’s largest banks, saw its value plummet from $65 billion to a debt of N141 billion ($900,000), highlighting the scale of mismanagement and financial deterioration. The case of Oceanic Bank is particularly revealing. 
Mrs. Ibru and Mr. Oboden Ibru, board members, were implicated in governance violations, with 75% of the bank’s non-performing loans tied to enterprises they owned or controlled (Sanusi, 2009). Insider lending, unlawful credits, and asset acquisitions by family-owned shell companies violated corporate governance principles, while the CEO, Mrs. Ibru, awarded procurement contracts to her own shell companies on favorable terms. CBN Governor Sanusi (2009) emphasized that “weak corporate governance…at financial institutions were the root of the banking sector that almost collapsed in 2009,” a view supported by the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), which executed insolvency activities on 425 financial institutions between 1988 and 2020 (Udo, 2020).
The repercussions of bank defaults in Nigeria extend beyond individual institutions, threatening financial stability and stakeholder interests. High levels of non-performing loan (NPL) ratios, peaking at 37% in 2009, eroded bank capital and liquidity, undermining their ability to meet depositor demands and fulfill lending roles (Nwosu, 2020). This loss of confidence among depositors, shareholders, and creditors destabilized the financial system, with ripple effects on the broader economy. The moral hazard problem, evident in cases like Oceanic Bank, saw depositors’ funds misused, shifting risk to taxpayers and necessitating costly bailouts, such as the $3.9 billion CBN intervention in 2009. 
Lack of transparency, including falsification of financial statements, further compounded the issue. This information asymmetry prevented stakeholders from making informed decisions, masking the true financial health of banks anddelaying corrective action (Abubakar, 2011). The social burden was significant, as bank failures disrupted access to credit, hindered economic growth, and eroded public trust in the banking sector. Moreover, the prevalence of concentrated ownership and weak board oversight amplified agency conflicts, with managers prioritizing personal gain over sustainable growth, further jeopardizing depositors and the economy at large.

In response to these crises, the Nigerian government and the CBN have implemented several measures to bolster stability and governance in deposit money banks. In 2006, a consolidation strategy aimed to strengthen banks by merging weaker institutions, while in 2009, the CBN mandated a minimum capital base of 25 billion naira ($162 million) for insured banks (Onaolapo et al., 2019). These efforts sought to enhance resilience and liquidity, though challenges persisted. The CBN’s 2009 intervention, injecting $3.9 billion into ten banks and dismissing eight managing directors, addressed immediate liquidity crises but also exposed deep-seated governance failures (Fadare, 2011). Regulatory actions extended to enforcement, with the CBN removing 178 bank executives and blacklisting 75 for weak governance practices tied to agency issues (Jimoh & Iyoha, 2012). The NDIC played a critical role, managing insolvency for 425 institutions between 1988 and 2020, highlighting the scale of the challenge (Udo, 2020). 
Deposit insurance andprudential regulations, such as capital adequacy requirements and risk-based deposit insurance premiums, were introduced to protect depositors and curb risky behavior by bank owners reliant on government guarantees (Demirguc-Kunt & Huizinga, 2010; World Bank, 2019). Despite these measures, regulatory multiplicity and inconsistent enforcement remain obstacles. Post-consolidation, many banksgrew in size but suffered from poor management, ill-functioning board committees, and a lack of expertise, undermining governance mechanisms (Abubakar, 2011). The CBN and scholars like Kasum (2014) stress that corporate governance and agency issues were leading contributors to the 2009 crisis,necessitating ongoing monitoring and evaluation to ensure the effectiveness of these reforms in protecting depositors and promoting sustainability.
The recurring defaults in Nigerian deposit money banks highlight the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to corporate governance and regulation. Weak governance, agency conflicts, and inadequate risk management have fueled systemic instability, with high non-performing loan (NPL) ratios and moral hazard problems posing ongoing threats. While consolidation, capital requirements, and regulatory interventions have provided temporary relief, the persistence of supervisory gaps and the lack of board expertise demand further reform. Addressing these challenges requires strengthening board oversight, enhancing transparency, and aligning regulatory frameworks to mitigate risk, protect stakeholders, and ensure the long-term stability of Nigeria’s banking sector. This research contributes to these efforts by examining corporate governance practices to propose actionable reforms that enhance financial stability in Nigeria’s banking sector.
1.1.3 Issues of Financial Regulatory Multiplicity in Nigeria
Regulatory multiplicity in corporate governance pertains to the presence of various codes of conduct that govern the behaviors and responsibilities of stakeholders within an industry (John, J. 2023, Ofo, 2013; Agebite, 2014). There is an imperative for enhanced clarity regarding the definition and implementation of corporate governance codes, which serve to delineate the expected conduct of employees in particular situations (Brooks, 1989). This issue is especially evident in Nigeria, where conflicting legal frameworks undermine the autonomy of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee. Such conflict arises from the ownership structures of firms and contributes to inadequate accounting and internal governance practices, as well as overlapping and conflicting rules and responsibilities (Abdulmalik, 2020).
Moreover, the state of corporate governance in Nigeria is still developing, given that the nation has only been sovereign for 64 years. Approximately fouty percent of listed companies demonstrate a lack of understanding regarding the principles of corporate governance, a situation that can be traced back to the pre-colonial period in Nigeria (Nwaukwa, N. N., 2024; Oromaraghako, P. B. O. et al., 2021; Wilson, 2006). This highlights the critical need for comprehensive reforms in regulatory frameworks to enhance the effectiveness of corporate governance in the country.
To effectively address the unique characteristics of a country, including cultural and political ideologies, it is important for countries to have corporate governance regulations that cater to their specific needs and reflect their colonial influences (Senaratne & Gunaratne, 2008; Lu et al., 2009; Ahunwan 2002; Adebite and Nakajima 2011; Okike & Adegbite, 2012). Governments regulate companies and companies are held legally accountable through their directors to shareholders and stakeholders through the concept of the 'corporate social contract' (Brooks, 1989). Cultural peculiarities and colonial influence have resulted in a lack of objectiveregulations in the Nigerian context, where banks are unable to facilitate the development of effective legislation in the baking industry (Ugochukwu, 2000).
Despite the increasing recognition of the need for effective corporate governance regulations, there is a lack of literature on the implications of regulatory multiplicity at the national level (Adgebite, 2012; Adebite, 2014). On one hand, soft law promotes autonomy by encouraging voluntary compliance with good governance practices (See Figure 1.1 above), while on the other hand, statutes carry a legal burden of responsibility for non-compliance (Adegbite, 2012; Adegbite, 2014) (See Figure 1.1 above). The argument for a statutory system of corporate governance in Nigeria is reinforced by the frequent failures of listed companies, linked to inadequate enforcement of regulations by regulatory agencies in addition to the saturation of regulations (Nwoke. et al 2023, Tayo-Tiwo, A 2020). This position is substantiated by Wilson (2006), emphasizing the crucial role of strict to fundamental principles of corporate governance.
The argument for an effective statutory system of corporate governance in Nigeria is further supported by the position of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD posits that, in countries with weak judicial systems, such as Nigeria (Abdulmalik, 2020), independent regulatory enforcement may be more effective than judicial enforcement (Nwoke. et al 2023, Oman, 2001). This highlights the importance of regulatory agencies in promoting compliance with corporate governance principles and ensuring the accountability and transparency of listed companies. The issues of regulatory multiplicity continue to evolve with the development of new codes of conduct or revisions to existing regulations, exacerbating the proliferation of codes within Nigeria (Tayo-Tiwo, A 2020, Abdulmalik 2020, Adebite, 2014).
However, the existence of multiple codes within a single country can address the specific needs of different firms and industries (Engle 2007, Moghalu 2011). Despite its potential benefits, this approach to corporate governance is also met with controversy (See Figure 1.1 above). Some argue that multiple self-regulatory codes increase investor confidence (Macey and O’Hara, 2003, BCBS, 2005, BCBS 2006; Hoffmann, 1998), while others argue that it creates an environment of uncertainty and lack of cohesion among firms (Osemeke, L. et al 2016, Agebite, 2014). Additionally, this uncertainty of applicable code can lead to weak enforcement and difficulty in distinguishing between firms that comply with good govern (Tayo-Tiwo, A 2020, Abdulmalik 2020, Adebite, 2014).
The persistence of conflicting regulatory frameworks not only disrupts the day-to-day operations of Nigerian deposit money banks but also poses systemic risks to their long-term stability and resilience. Addressing these challenges forms a key focus of this research, particularly in exploring how governance mechanisms—such as audit-committee independence (and its mediation by financial-reporting integrity as perceived by bank insiders in 2024) and regulatory clarity and enforcement consistency—influence the risk of bank default within the context of regulatory multiplicity in the Nigerian deposit money banking industry. These governance structures are vital tools for mitigating agency problems and reinforcing internal controls, which remain crucial within a financial sector characterized by overlapping and occasionally contradictory regulatory requirements (See Figure 1.2 below).

1.1.4: Bank governance challenges in Nigeria
The historical evolution of corporate governance in Nigeria, particularly within the deposit money banking sector, is deeply intertwined with its pre-colonial and colonial legacies, highlighting a complex legal and institutional heritage that continues to shape its current challenges (Brennan, N. M., & Solomon, J., 2008). Pre-colonial Nigeria consisted of distinct regional governance systems, such as those of the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo, which operated through customary laws, monarchies, and communal structures. These frameworks, though informal by Western standards, were legitimate and effective systems for regulating trade, resolving disputes, and allocating resources (Altin, M., 2024; Elias, T. O., 2024). Businesses during this era were often family-owned or organized through community-based guilds, lacking the formal corporate governance structures seen today.
The colonial period (1861–1960) marked significant changes to Nigeria’s governance systems. British colonial administrators imposed foreign legal frameworks, such as the Companies Ordinance of 1912, modeled on the UK Companies Act (Agamah, M., 2024). These provisions were tailored to serve colonial enterprises like the Royal Niger Company and were exploitative in intent, prioritizing the colonial government’s agenda over the developmental needs of local businesses (Elias, T. O., 2024). They introduced Western corporate concepts, including limited liability and boards, but failed to integrate the socio-economic realities of Nigeria, disregarding indigenous governance systems and embedding a rigid legal template that persisted post-independence (Adegbite et al., 2012).
Following independence in 1960, Nigeria inherited this colonial legal infrastructure, which presented significant challenges in developing a governance system aligned with its economic and institutional realities (Elias, T. O., 2024). Instead of replacing colonial laws entirely, policymakers amended and expanded the existing framework, as seen in the Companies Act of 1968 (later replaced by the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020, or CAMA). These adaptations aimed to modernize the governance structure to support a growing economy and attract foreign investment. However, gaps in institutional capacity and the necessity for legal continuity limited progress, impeding the creation of a cohesive governance model suited to the Nigerian context (Udo, 2020). 
As Nigeria’s economy grew, particularly in sectors like oil, telecommunications, and banking, regulatory bodies such as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) emerged. These institutions sought to address sector-specific issues by introducing additional governance codes. However, rather than replacing the colonial legal foundation, newer frameworks were layered on top, resulting in conflicting and overlapping regulations. For example, Section 279 of CAMA outlines general director duties, which can conflict with the more detailed governance requirements of the CBN Code, creating ambiguity for banks operating under these intersecting guidelines (Osemeke & Adegbite, 2016).
This history of regulatory multiplicity contributes to ongoing governance challenges in the Nigerian deposit money banking system (Babajide, Abiola Ayopo, et al., 2020). Cases of fraud and mismanagement have highlighted the inadequacies of current governance structures. Despite regulatory instruments such as the CBN Act, the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA), and the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) Act, enforcement remains weak (Nwoke, U., et al., 2023). The CBN Act of 2007 grants the Central Bank autonomy to oversee financial institutions, while BOFIA ensures regulatory powers over banking operations (Obadire, A. M., et al., 2022). However, enforcement of these laws is undermined by institutional weaknesses, such as outdated sanctions and resource constraints, as noted in the ROSC (2004) report (Azoro et al., 2022).
 The conflicts between regulatory frameworks exacerbate governance challenges for Nigerian deposit money banks. For example, while the CBN Code explicitly prohibits family members from simultaneously occupying key board positions such as Chairman and CEO, the SEC Code (2011) does not impose similar limitations, creating regulatory inconsistencies. This misalignment fosters opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, enabling banks to selectively comply with mandatory codes like the CBN’s while neglecting voluntary recommendations from the SEC. Consequently, such contradictions weaken the impact of governance reforms and undermine institutional accountability within the banking sector (Osemeke & Adegbite, 2016).
The relationship between board structure and organizational performance in the Nigerian deposit money banking industry further complicates reform efforts. Globally, empirical studies have yielded mixed findings on whether board size and complexity correlate with organizational performance. While some studies indicate no significant relationship (Romano et al., 2012; Al Hawary, 2011), others suggest varying outcomes based on institutional and cultural contexts (Adams & Mehran, 2003; Trabelsi, 2010). In Nigeria, governance obstacles such as concentrated ownership and unqualified board members further undermine the potential for effective oversight, even when formal governance frameworks are in place.
Enforcement gaps across regulatory institutions amplify these challenges. Reports such as the ROSC (2004) indicate that the CBN lacks sufficient capacity to ensure compliance with financial reporting standards, while the SEC struggles with effective oversight within the capital markets. These structural deficiencies have allowed instances of governance failure, such as mismanagement and financial impropriety, to persist in the banking sector, eroding trust and stability (Nwoke, U., 2023).
To address these critical issues, it is imperative to unify and harmonize Nigeria’s regulatory frameworks while bolstering enforcement capabilities. Streamlining governance codes would reduce ambiguities and foster coherence in regulatory oversight (Osemeke & Adegbite, 2016). Furthermore, research into the connection between board composition and performance in Nigerian deposit money banks could offer evidence-based insights into effective governance practices. Strengthening institutional capacity and aligning governance practices with the local context are essential to improving transparency, accountability, and overall governance outcomes in the financial sector. Corporate governance challenges in Nigeria’s deposit money banking industry are deeply rooted in the historical legacy of colonial legal systems, compounded by regulatory overlaps and institutional inefficiencies. While reforms have been introduced to improve governance structures, the persistence of conflicting regulations and weak enforcement undermines their effectiveness. A consistent and localized approach to governance, coupled with stronger regulatory enforcement, is vital to ensuring the long-term sustainability and resilience of Nigerian deposit money banks. This research particularly examines how governance mechanisms, such as audit-committee independence (mediated by financial-reporting integrity as perceived by bank insiders in 2024) and management qualifications (measured by banking experience and governance training from 2024 data), interact with the clarity and enforcement consistency of regulatory frameworks to influence non-performing loan (NPL) ratios, providing insights into mitigating default risk in the context of Nigeria’s fragmented regulatory environment.


1.2: Problem Question
The Nigerian deposit money banking sector faces profound corporate governance challenges, rooted in a complex historical legacy and intensified by systemic governance failures in the post-consolidation era, which collectively elevate the risk of bank defaults and threaten the stability of a sector vital to Nigeria’s economic growth. Historically, pre-colonial Nigeria relied on indigenous systems—such as those of the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo—where customary laws, monarchies, and communal structures governed trade and economic activity within family-based guilds (Elias, T. O., 2024; Altin, M., 2024). The colonial era (1861–1960) disrupted this, with British administrators imposing foreign legal frameworks like the Companies Ordinance of 1912, modeled on the UK Companies Act, to serve colonial interests, neglecting local realities (Agamah, M., 2024; Adegbite et al., 2012). 
Post-independence in 1960, Nigeria inherited this misaligned system, and policymakers layered adaptations—such as the Companies Act of 1968 and the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020—struggling against limited institutional capacity to align governance with Nigeria’s unique context (Udo, 2020). The government’s pre-1986 role as owner and regulator of banks bred conflicts of interest, a legacy persisting despite the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) of 1986–1993, which divested state shares, leaving fiscal irresponsibility and politically motivated board appointments (Chinweoda, U. O., et al., 2020; Ugochukwu, 2000). The 2004 banking consolidation, reducing banks from 89 to 24 to strengthen the sector, aimed to address these historical weaknesses but instead exposed and amplified pervasive governance failures that continue to undermine the industry (Kafidipe, 2021).
In the post-consolidation era, corporate governance breakdowns proliferate, undermining accountability and transparency across multiple dimensions. Boards of directors lack independence, with former CBN Governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi noting chairmen and CEOs exert overbearing influence, directors display weak ethical standards, and board committees remain inefficient or dormant (Sanusi, 2014). Audit-committee independence, critical for transparent reporting, is often swayed by majority shareholders and management despite CAMA Section 359(4)’s mandate for equal representation, leading to unreviewed financial statements and weakened financial-reporting integrity (Adegbite, 2014). Risk management failures are rampant, with banks extending credit without proper checks, resulting in non-performing loan (NPL) ratios reaching twenty percent in 2017 against a five percent regulatory threshold, fueling distress in banks like Intercontinental Bank, Finbank, and Bank PHB (Adegboye, 2020; Adeusi et al., 2013; Owolabi, 2013).
Fraud concealment erodes trust, as the absence of robust whistleblowing mechanisms allows conflicts of interest and financial impropriety to go undetected, a key factor in the 2009 banking crisis (Olojede, P., et al., 2020). Nomination committee issues further weaken governance, with sixty-one percent of banks lacking independent nomination committees, enabling concentrated ownership to dominate appointments and entrench management’s self-interest over stakeholders (Ogbechie, 2016; Osemeke, L. & Adegbite, 2016).
Management qualifications represent a critical governance failure, deeply undermining the sector’s integrity and stability. The prevalence of unqualified or politically motivated appointments to executive and board roles, a legacy of historical government interference, persists in the post-consolidation era, weakening strategic oversight, ethical compliance, and operational competence (Nwoko, U., et al., 2022). In cases like Oceanic Bank, poor management qualifications contributed to catastrophic governance lapses, where over seventy-five percent of NPLs in 2009 were tied to insider loans and unauthorized credits to companies controlled by the Ibru family, facilitated by leadership lacking the expertise or independence to challenge such practices (Sanusi, 2009). 
Politically influenced appointments, often prioritizing connections over merit, result in executives and directors ill-equipped to navigate complex financial systems, implement robust risk controls, or uphold accounting standards, exacerbating financial misreporting and agency problems (Nwoko, U., et al., 2022; Osemeke, L. & Adegbite, 2016). The absence of stringent qualification criteria—such as financial expertise, governance training, or proven leadership experience—allows unqualified managers to occupy critical roles, undermining decision-making and strategic planning, as seen in the collapses of Intercontinental Bank, Finbank, and Bank PHB, where mismanagement by underqualified leadership fueled financial distress (Owolabi, 2013). This lack of competent, independent management, unchecked by weak or absent nomination processes, perpetuates a culture of unethical behavior, poor risk assessment, and inadequate oversight, directly contributing to the sector’s vulnerability to defaults (Sanusi, 2014; Nwoko, U., et al., 2022).
Regulatory multiplicity, a byproduct of Nigeria’s fragmented historical framework, intensifies these governance failures. Conflicting codes—such as CAMA 2020, the Nigerian Code of Corporate Governance (NCCG) 2018, CBN Corporate Governance Guidelines 2023, and the SEC Code of 2011—create ambiguity, with disparities in board composition, CEO tenure, and enforcement (e.g., CAMA’s legal fines vs. NCCG’s “Apply and Explain” flexibility) allowing banks to evade rigorous standards (Abdulmalik, S. O., 2020; Osemeke, L., et al., 2016). Weak enforcement by regulators like the Corporate Affairs Commission, Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria, and CBN, constrained by institutional weaknesses, fails to address risk management lapses, fraud, and unqualified management, a direct outcome of these governance flaws (Nwoke, U., et al., 2023; Kafidipe, 2021; Adegbite, 2014; Udo, B., 2020). 
These failures erode stakeholder confidence, trigger mass deposit withdrawals, and threaten Nigeria’s economy, where banks are engines of growth (King & Levine, 1993; Siyanbola, 2019). Despite this urgency, a research gap persists, particularly in Nigeria, on how post-consolidation governance failures—risk management deficiencies, fraud concealment, nomination committee weaknesses, and unqualified management—interact with historical legacies and regulatory multiplicity to drive default risk (Osita, et al., 2019; Tsamenyi, et al., 2007). The lack of up-to-date, context-specific studies amplifies this gap. This research seeks to address this lacuna by examining the efficacy of audit-committee independence (mediated by financial-reporting integrity as perceived by bank insiders) and management qualifications in fostering accountability and transparency, analyzing the impact of historical and current governance failures in the post-consolidation era, and advocating for a harmonized, enforceable framework aligned with global standards to mitigate bank defaults, restore trust, and enhance the resilience of Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector. 
Nigeria's deposit money banking sector has endured recurrent disruptions from credit-quality shocks, with the most acute instance unfolding in 2009/10, when average non-performing loan ratios (NPLRs) surged beyond 35%. Although macroeconomic fluctuations account for a portion of this escalation, firm-level analyses reveal that deficiencies in internal governance—manifesting as inadequate risk management, insufficient disclosure, lenient credit practices, and inconsistent regulatory compliance—exacerbated the concentration of loan losses (Sanusi, 2010; CBN, 2014). In response, post-crisis regulatory interventions, including the adoption of Basel-II, IFRS-9, and the Corporate Governance Codes of 2014 and 2018, were designed to fortify three core governance indices: disclosure, practice, and compliance.

1.3 Research Question
This study is guided by four research questions that systematically explore the interplay between corporate governance mechanisms and non-performing loan (NPL) ratios in Nigeria's deposit money banking sector. These questions address critical gaps in the literature, particularly the need for context-specific analyses of governance indices, audit independence, management qualifications, and regulatory clarity amid historical banking crises and ongoing reforms. RQ1 focuses exclusively on secondary panel data analysis from 2009 to 2024, utilizing publicly available financial reports and regulatory disclosures from Nigerian deposit money banks to examine longitudinal trends. In contrast, RQ2, RQ3, and RQ4 incorporate a 2024 cross-sectional study, integrating quantitative data from questionnaires with qualitative insights from semi-structured interviews to capture contemporary stakeholder perspectives and bank-specific dynamics.
RQ1: To what extent do corporate governance indices (disclosure, practice, and compliance) influence non-performing loan ratios in Nigerian deposit money banks over the period 2009–2024, controlling for bank size, capital adequacy, and macroeconomic factors? (Quantitative analysis)
RQ2: To what extent does audit-committee independence reduce non-performing loan ratios in Nigerian deposit-money banks in 2024, and is this effect mediated by strengthened financial-reporting integrity as perceived by bank insiders? (Mixed methods)
RQ3: To what extent is the association between management qualifications—measured by banking experience and governance training as reported in the 2024 data—related to non-performing loan (NPL) ratios in Nigerian deposit money banks based on a 2024 cross-sectional study? (Mixed methods)
RQ4: To what extent is the association between the clarity and enforcement consistency of regulatory frameworks—measured by stakeholder perceptions in the 2024 questionnaire and interviews—related to non-performing loan (NPL) ratios in Nigerian deposit money banks based on a 2024 cross-sectional study? (Mixed methods)



1.4: Objective of Study
This research aims to bridge the gap in context-specific investigations of corporate governance within Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector by scrutinizing governance mechanisms, identifying systemic weaknesses, and recommending targeted reforms to curb default risk and bolster financial stability. Drawing on Hypotheses 1–4 (H1–H4) and Research Questions 1–4 (RQ1–RQ4), which probe the connections among corporate governance indices, audit committee independence, management qualifications, and regulatory clarity, and non-performing loan (NPL) ratios, the study is structured around the following objectives. These objectives adopt a mixed-methods framework to ensure comprehensive analysis: RQ1 relies on secondary panel data from 2009–2024 for longitudinal quantitative assessment, while RQ2–RQ4 leverage 2024 cross-sectional data from questionnaires and interviews for nuanced, contemporary insights. This approach not only enhances empirical depth but also contextualizes findings within Nigeria's unique regulatory and economic landscape, marked by post-2009 reforms and persistent challenges like macroeconomic volatility and governance lapses.
OB1: To assess the extent to which the integrated framework of corporate governance indices—encompassing disclosure (Corporate Governance Disclosure Index, CGDI), practice (Bank Practice Score, OPEFF), and compliance (Banking Compliance Index, COMID)—mitigates non-performing loan ratios among Nigeria's leading deposit money banks across the 2009–2024 reform era, controlling for bank size, capital adequacy, and macroeconomic factors, with particular emphasis on discerning the index yielding the greatest incremental impact on credit quality pre- and post- the 2014 Corporate Governance Code implementation. This objective fills a critical research void by evaluating how compliance with evolving governance standards, including the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Guidelines 2023 and subsequent updates, promotes accountability and transparency to diminish default risk (Sanusi, 2009). In alignment with Hypothesis 1 and Research Question 1, it delves into the nexus between governance stringency and NPLs, drawing on historical precedents like the 2009 banking crisis that exposed vulnerabilities amplified by weak internal controls and fragmented oversight (Osemeke & Adegbite, 2016). By analyzing secondary panel data from audited financial statements and regulatory reports spanning 2009–2024, this objective isolates the effects of governance indices while controlling for confounders such as bank size, capital adequacy (via Total Capital Adequacy Ratio, TCAR), and macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP growth, inflation, oil prices), thereby providing robust evidence on reform efficacy in an emerging market context (Kafidipe et al., 2021).
OB2: To quantify the direct and indirect (mediated) association between audit-committee independence and 2024 NPL ratios in Nigerian deposit money banks, using (i) published financial data and (ii) insider perceptions of financial-reporting integrity gathered from the existing governance questionnaire. This objective confronts the dearth of localized empirical studies by scrutinizing how audit-committee independence deters hazardous lending behaviors, a recurring issue in Nigeria’s banking sector following the 2005 consolidation and 2009 crisis (Sanusi, 2014). Correlating with Hypothesis 2 and Research Question 2, it emphasizes accountability structures essential for rectifying governance shortcomings, in line with international benchmarks such as the OECD (2023) principles and recent calls for fully independent audit committees in Nigeria to mitigate NPL risks (Al-Shaer et al., 2022; Nwoke et al., 2023). Through cross-sectional analysis of 2024 data, including Likert-scale responses on committee composition and oversight efficacy, this objective highlights the mediating role of financial-reporting integrity in enhancing transparency and curbing managerial opportunism in emerging markets.
OB3: To evaluate the association between management qualifications—encompassing extensive banking experience, specialized governance training, and relevant certifications as captured in 2024 data—and non-performing loan (NPL) ratios in Nigerian deposit money banks, based on a 2024 cross-sectional study utilizing questionnaires and interviews. Addressing a notable gap in research on human capital's influence on bank performance, this objective examines how qualified leadership fosters prudent credit risk management and ethical practices, countering issues like insider lending that plagued Nigeria's banks during past crises (Sanusi, 2009; Ejike et al., 2022). Aligned with Hypothesis 3 and Research Question 3, it tests the premise that experienced and trained managers reduce NPLs by improving decision-making and oversight, drawing on upper echelons theory and recent studies linking managerial expertise to lower default risks in African banking contexts (Ozili, 2020; Hambrick & Mason, 1984). The cross-sectional design incorporates stakeholder perceptions from 2024 surveys, quantifying qualifications through metrics like years of experience and training hours, to provide actionable insights into leadership's role in enhancing resilience amid Nigeria's oil-dependent economy.
OB4: To assess the influence of clear and consistently enforced regulatory frameworks on fostering compliance and reducing NPL ratios in Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector. This objective responds to scholarly appeals for unified regulatory structures by dissecting how clarity in frameworks—such as the harmonized application of CAMA 2020, NCCG 2018, and CBN Guidelines 2023—alleviates governance failures in Nigeria’s multifaceted regulatory environment (Abdulmalik & Ahmad, 2020). In harmony with Hypothesis 4 and Research Question 4, it bridges gaps in existing literature by leveraging 2024 cross-sectional data to analyze stakeholder views on enforcement consistency, promoting stability through regulations aligned with global standards (Nwoke et al., 2023; CBN, 2024). By incorporating qualitative interviews and quantitative perceptions, this objective underscores the need for robust enforcement to mitigate NPL spikes driven by regulatory ambiguities.
OB5: To formulate actionable recommendations for a harmonized corporate governance framework, aligned with global standards, to mitigate bank defaults, restore stakeholder trust, and enhance the resilience of Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector. This culminating objective integrates insights from OB1–OB4 to advocate pragmatic reforms that rectify entrenched governance issues, informed by empirical data and contextual narratives. It advances the study's overarching goal by proposing a cohesive framework resonant with OECD (2023) principles and recent regulatory evolutions, ensuring recommendations are evidence-based and adaptable to Nigeria's dynamic financial ecosystem (Aguilera & Ruiz Castillo, 2025). The mixed-methods paradigm underpins this, blending quantitative rigor with qualitative depth for holistic policy implications.
The research embraces a pragmatic epistemology, merging positivist quantitative analyses (e.g., panel and cross-sectional regressions) with interpretivist qualitative explorations (e.g., thematic analysis of interviews) to tackle Nigeria’s multifaceted governance dilemmas (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). This dual lens ensures methodological robustness and relevance, with a detailed epistemological rationale outlined in the methodology chapter.
Table 2: Linking Research Questions to Hypotheses


Research Question (RQ)	Hypothesis (H)	Linkage Explanation
RQ1: To what extent do corporate governance indices (disclosure, practice, and compliance) influence non-performing loan ratios in Nigerian deposit money banks over the period 2009–2024, controlling for bank size, capital adequacy, and macroeconomic factors?	H1: Banks with robust governance practices exhibit lower default risk, as measured by reduced NPL ratios.	RQ1 directly tests H1 by quantifying the influence of governance indices (e.g., CGDI for disclosure, OPEFF for practice, COMID for compliance) on NPL ratios via secondary panel data analysis (2009–2024). It operationalizes the hypothesis within Nigeria’s reform context, controlling for variables to isolate governance effects on default risk amid fragmented regulations.
RQ2: To what extent does audit-committee independence reduce non-performing loan ratios in Nigerian deposit-money banks in 2024, and is this effect mediated by strengthened financial-reporting integrity as perceived by bank insiders?	H2: Greater audit-committee independence is significantly associated with lower 2024 NPL ratios (direct effect), and this association is partly mediated by higher financial-reporting integrity (indirect effect).	RQ2 aligns with H2 by assessing the direct and mediated (via financial-reporting integrity) impact of audit-committee independence on NPL ratios through 2024 cross-sectional data, probing how insider perceptions bolster oversight and integrity to curb default risk, enabling empirical validation of these mechanisms' efficacy.
RQ3: To what extent is the association between management qualifications—measured by banking experience and governance training as reported in the 2024 data—related to non-performing loan (NPL) ratios in Nigerian deposit money banks based on a 2024 cross-sectional study?	H3: Banks with qualified management exhibit lower default risk, as measured by reduced NPL ratios.	RQ3 corresponds to H3 by evaluating management qualifications' effect on NPLs via 2024 data, testing how expertise enhances risk management and ethics to lower default risk, facilitating targeted data on leadership attributes.
RQ4: To what extent is the association between the clarity and enforcement consistency of regulatory frameworks—measured by stakeholder perceptions in the 2024 questionnaire and interviews—related to non-performing loan (NPL) ratios in Nigerian deposit money banks based on a 2024 cross-sectional study?	H4: Banks under clear regulatory frameworks exhibit lower default risk, as measured by reduced NPL ratios.	RQ4 maps to H4 by examining regulatory clarity's influence on NPLs through 2024 perceptions, operationalizing how consistent enforcement promotes compliance and mitigates default risk in Nigeria’s regulatory mosaic.

1.5: Hypothesis Development
This study investigates corporate governance's role in mitigating default risk in Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector, employing non-performing loan (NPL) ratios—defined as loans overdue by 90 days or more relative to total loans—as the key proxy for default risk. NPLs encapsulate failures in loan recovery, eroding capital bases and heightening insolvency threats, and have underpinned Nigeria’s recurrent banking upheavals, including the 2009 peak of 37% and 2017 surge to 20%, often exacerbated by governance shortfalls like deficient risk frameworks and insider abuses (Adegboye, 2020; Sanusi, 2009). Their relevance is affirmed by alignment with the CBN’s 5% benchmark and extensive use in emerging market scholarship, though limitations include a narrow focus on credit risk (potentially ignoring liquidity or operational risks) and data opacity in Nigeria’s reporting milieu (Natufe & Evbayiro-Osagie, 2023; Fernando et al., 2019; Olojede et al., 2020). To counteract these, NPL data are triangulated from CBN, NDIC, and audited reports; controls (e.g., bank size, GDP growth, oil prices) isolate governance influences; and qualitative interview data add depth. For RQ1, analysis draws on secondary panel data from 2009–2024, enabling longitudinal examination of reform impacts, while RQ2–RQ4 utilize 2024 cross-sectional data for timely snapshots.
Four hypotheses scrutinize governance-NPL linkages via a mixed-methods lens: 7-point Likert-scale questionnaires, semi-structured interviews with executives and regulators, observational governance assessments, and SPSS-driven regressions for p-values (significance) and R-squared (variance explained). These are rooted in Nigeria’s governance woes, including a patchwork of regulations (CAMA 2020, NCCG 2018, CBN Guidelines 2023) and over 425 bank failures since 1988, frequently linked to lax oversight and ethical breaches (Sanusi, 2014; Osemeke & Adegbite, 2016; Kafidipe et al., 2021).
H1: Stronger corporate governance indices (higher CGDI, OPEFF, and COMID) jointly and significantly reduce the non-performing loan ratio, with the magnitude of the reduction being largest for the practice index (OPEFF) and most potent in the post-2014 mandatory-disclosure regime.
This hypothesis asserts that Nigerian deposit money banks demonstrating strong adherence to corporate governance indices—specifically disclosure (Corporate Governance Disclosure Index, CGDI), practice (Bank Practice Score, OPEFF), and compliance (Banking Compliance Index, COMID)—within a fragmented regulatory framework achieve lower NPL ratios than those with lax implementation. Robust governance cultivates accountability, transparency, and proactive risk mitigation, thereby curbing default propensities. Grounded in agency theory, it highlights mechanisms that reconcile managerial and stakeholder interests, averting agency conflicts that spur imprudent lending (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). In Nigeria, such deficiencies intensified the 2009 crisis through insider lending and opaque boards (Sanusi, 2014). Stewardship theory augments this, positing empowered boards as stewards fostering stability via rigorous mandates (Donaldson & Davis, 1991). 
The regulatory mosaic, with overlapping codes, fosters evasion, but stricter compliance (e.g., CBN 2023) correlates with reduced NPLs in emerging contexts (Kafidipe et al., 2021; Fernando et al., 2019). Cases like Oceanic Bank's 2009 downfall exemplify selective compliance's perils. Confounders include macroeconomic turbulence (oil shocks) or cultural patronage networks. Governance is gauged via secondary panel data (2009–2024) on indices from bank reports, tested through fixed-effects regression controlling for size, capital adequacy (via Total Capital Adequacy Ratio, TCAR), and macros. This integration of theories illuminates governance as a vital shield against default in Nigeria’s volatile setting. H2: Greater audit-committee independence is significantly associated with lower 2024 NPL ratios (direct effect), and this association is partly mediated by higher financial-reporting integrity (indirect effect).
This hypothesis maintains that banks featuring greater audit-committee independence attain lower NPL ratios via superior oversight and reporting fidelity, restraining risky loans and elevating portfolio quality, with the effect partly mediated by strengthened financial-reporting integrity as perceived by bank insiders. Anchored in agency theory, it underscores committees' mitigation of opportunism through vigilant monitoring (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). In Nigeria, compromised audits fueled 2009 insider excesses (Sanusi, 2014). Resource dependence theory bolsters this, framing committees as conduits for expertise and legitimacy in risk governance (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Amid shareholder pressures and enforcement gaps, independent committees are pivotal for loan integrity, particularly when financial-reporting integrity mediates the pathway to timely loss recognition. Evidence from emerging markets affirms their NPL-reducing impact (Al-Shaer et al., 2022; Nwoke et al., 2023). Oceanic Bank's collapse underscores audit lapses' costs. External interferences or economic shocks may dilute effects. Independence is assessed via 2024 Likert responses on composition and frequency, from financials, regressed with controls, incorporating mediation analysis for financial-reporting integrity. Theories emphasize committees' accountability and expertise in curbing default.
H3: Banks with qualified management exhibit lower default risk, as measured by reduced NPL ratios.
This hypothesis proposes that management with substantial banking tenure and governance training yields lower NPLs through enhanced oversight and ethics. Based on upper echelons theory, executives' profiles dictate outcomes (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). Qualified leaders adeptly handle volatility. Stewardship theory views them as stability guardians (Donaldson & Davis, 1991). 
In Nigeria, political appointments exacerbated 2009 NPLs at 75% in cases like Oceanic (Sanusi, 2009). Studies tie expertise to reduced NPLs via ethics and risk acumen (Ejike et al., 2022; Ozili, 2020). Political meddling or volatility may override. Qualifications are measured via 2024 Likert on experience/certifications, from reports, regressed with controls. Theories spotlight management's expertise in default mitigation. H4: Banks under clear regulatory frameworks exhibit lower default risk, as measured by reduced NPL ratios.
This hypothesis argues that clear, enforced regulations lower NPLs by bolstering compliance and risk practices. Institutional theory sees frameworks molding behavior (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). Nigeria’s overlaps enable evasion (Abdulmalik & Ahmad, 2020). Agency theory aligns actions with interests (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). Clarity links to lower NPLs (Nwoke et al., 2023; Fernando et al., 2019). 2009 evasion highlights needs. Enforcement weaknesses or shocks may hinder. Clarity is evaluated via 2024 Likert on consistency, regressed with controls. Theories stress clarity's compliance-fostering role.
Regressions include controls to counter confounders, VIF for multicollinearity, lags for NPL delays. Data validation and triangulation address gaps in post-consolidation research (Ozili, 2020).







1.6: The scope of Study
This research tests corporate governance challenges in Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector, with a specific focus on deposit money banks (DMBs), to examine their impact on default risk, as measured by non-performing loan (NPL) ratios, and to propose reforms for enhancing financial stability. The scope is delimited to ensure a context-specific analysis that addresses the research gap in up-to-date, Nigeria-centric studies, as outlined in the problem statement (Osita et al., 2019; Tsamenyi et al., 2007). Below, the scope is defined in terms of institutional focus, geographic boundaries, time frame, thematic areas, and epistemological stance, providing a clear framework for the research.
The research is limited to deposit money banks operating in Nigeria, which are pivotal to the country’s financial system and economic growth (King & Levine, 1993; Siyanbola, 2019). Deposit money banks, as regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) under the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA), include commercial banks that accept deposits and provide loans, excluding other financial institutions such as microfinance banks, discount houses, or non-bank financial entities. This focus is justified by the document’s emphasis on the systemic risks posed by governance failures in these banks, evidenced by 425 failures since 1988 and high NPLs peaking at 37% in 2009 (Udo, 2020; Nwosu, 2020). 
Geographically, the research is confined to Nigeria, reflecting the unique historical, regulatory, and cultural context shaping its banking sector, including pre-colonial governance systems, colonial legacies (e.g., Companies Ordinance of 1912), and post-independence regulatory frameworks like CAMA 2020 (Elias, 2024; Abdulmalik & Ahmad, 2020). This Nigeria-specific scope ensures relevance to the identified governance challenges, such as regulatory multiplicity and politically motivated appointments, which are distinct to the country’s banking landscape (Osemeke & Adegbite, 2016).
The research covers two distinct time frames to align with the research questions. For RQ1, it spans 2009–2024, leveraging secondary panel data to capture longitudinal trends in corporate governance indices (disclosure, practice, compliance) and their impact on NPLs, reflecting post-2009 crisis reforms like Basel II, IFRS-9, and the 2014 Corporate Governance Code (Sanusi, 2010; CBN, 2024). For RQ2–RQ4, it focuses on a 2024 cross-sectional study, using questionnaire and interview data to provide contemporary insights into audit-committee independence, management qualifications, and regulatory clarity, addressing recent governance challenges (Adegboye, 2020; Nwoke et al., 2023). Historical data (e.g., 2009 crisis) are used for contextual analysis only (Sanusi, 2009; Olojede et al., 2020).
The research’s thematic scope is defined by the objectives (OB1–OB4) and research questions (RQ1–RQ4), focusing on four key areas of corporate governance in deposit money banks: Corporate Governance Indices (OB1, RQ1): Examining the effectiveness of disclosure (CGDI), practice (OPEFF), and compliance (COMID) in reducing NPLs, addressing deficiencies like weak accountability and lax lending practices (Sanusi, 2009; Osemeke & Adegbite, 2016). Audit-Committee Independence (OB2, RQ2): Evaluating its direct and mediated (via financial-reporting integrity as perceived by insiders) role in enhancing financial reporting integrity to curb risky lending, given its compromised independence in cases like Oceanic Bank (Sanusi, 2014; Olojede et al., 2020).
Management Qualifications (OB3, RQ3): Assessing the impact of banking experience and governance training on NPL reduction, targeting unqualified appointments (Sanusi, 2009; Ejike et al., 2022).
Regulatory Clarity and Enforcement Consistency (OB4, RQ4): Investigating the effect of clear, enforced regulatory frameworks on compliance and NPL reduction, targeting Nigeria’s fragmented codes (e.g., CAMA 2020, NCCG 2018) (Abdulmalik & Ahmad, 2020; Nwoke et al., 2023).
Proposing reforms aligned with global standards (e.g., OECD, 2023) to mitigate defaults and restore trust, addressing historical and current governance failures (Aguilera & Ruiz Castillo, 2025). This excludes other governance aspects, such as shareholder activism or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, unless they directly relate to NPLs or default risk. It also omits non-banking sectors and international comparisons, focusing solely on Nigeria’s deposit money banks to maintain depth and specificity.
The research adopts a pragmatic epistemological stance, integrating positivist and interpretivist paradigms to address the multifaceted governance challenges in Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector, as reiterated from the objectives section (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). Pragmatism views knowledge as context-dependent and problem-driven, prioritizing practical outcomes to inform governance reforms (OB4). The positivist paradigm underpins quantitative analysis, such as regression of NPL ratios, to objectively measure governance impacts, addressing data reliability through cross-validation with CBN, NDIC, and audited reports (Olojede et al., 2020). The interpretivist paradigm informs qualitative insights from stakeholder interviews, capturing subjective realities like regulatory perceptions and cultural patronage, which shape governance failures (Osemeke & Adegbite, 2016). This mixed-method approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of governance deficiencies, aligning with the research’s objectives and the document’s emphasis on context-specific insights. A detailed epistemological discussion is provided in the methodology chapter to further elucidate the knowledge generation process.
The research’s scope is intentionally narrow to ensure feasibility and focus. By limiting the institutional scope to deposit money banks, it excludes other financial institutions that may exhibit different governance dynamics. The geographic focus on Nigeria precludes comparative analyses with other countries, which could offer broader insights but dilute context-specificity. The dual time frames (2009–2024 for RQ1, 2024 for RQ2–RQ4) restrict historical analysis to contextual background for RQ2–RQ4, focusing on contemporary data to ensure relevance. The thematic scope, while comprehensive within governance mechanisms, omits peripheral issues (e.g., technological impacts on banking) unless directly tied to NPLs. These boundaries ensure a targeted investigation that addresses the research gap while acknowledging constraints that future studies may explore.
By focusing on deposit money banks in Nigeria from 2009–2024 for longitudinal analysis and 2024 for cross-sectional insights, the research provides timely, context-specific insights into governance challenges that threaten financial stability  (Udo, 2020; Adegboye, 2020). The pragmatic epistemological stance and mixed-method approach enable a robust analysis of governance mechanisms, regulatory frameworks, and reform needs, fulfilling the research’s aim to propose actionable solutions aligned with global standards (OECD, 2023). This scope positions the research to contribute meaningfully to policy reforms, stakeholder trust restoration, and the resilience of Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector, as outlined in the executive summary and problem statement.

1.7: Motivation of Study
A primary driver of this research is the alarming governance failures observed in Nigerian deposit money banks, particularly in the 2009–2024 period for longitudinal trends and 2024 for contemporary insights, where issues like inadequate risk management, weak internal controls, and lax lending practices have fueled non-performing loan (NPL) ratios and financial distress, as seen in cases like Oceanic Bank, Intercontinental Bank, Finbank, and Bank PHB (Adegboye, 2020; Adeusi et al., 2013; Owolabi, 2013). The lack of independent nomination committees in 61% of banks allows concentrated ownership to dominate appointments, entrenching management’s self-interest and weakening board oversight, while unqualified or politically motivated management appointments—lacking financial expertise or governance training—compromise ethics and strategic decision-making, as evidenced by Oceanic Bank’s insider loans tied to 75% of NPLs in 2009 (Ogbechie, 2016; Sanusi, 2009; Nwoko et al., 2022). These deficiencies, coupled with weak audit-committee independence and fraud concealment, erode stakeholder trust, trigger mass deposit withdrawals, and heighten systemic risks, necessitating a focused examination to address their impact on default risk (Olojede et al., 2020; Sanusi, 2014).
Regulatory multiplicity further motivates this research, as conflicting codes—such as CAMA 2020, NCCG 2018, CBN Corporate Governance Guidelines 2023, and SEC Code of 2011—combined with weak enforcement by regulators like the CAC, FRCN, and CBN, create ambiguity and enable banks to evade rigorous standards, exacerbating governance failures in the 2024 timeframe (Abdulmalik & Ahmad, 2020; Osemeke et al., 2016; Shaba, 2024). This fragmented regulatory landscape undermines accountability and transparency, critical pillars for financial stability, and highlights the urgent need for empirical insights into how these conflicts drive default risk and hinder effective governance.
The paucity of context-specific, up-to-date research on Nigeria’s deposit money banking sector, particularly post-consolidation, is a compelling motivator. While studies highlight governance failures and their economic consequences, few address the interplay of historical legacies, specific deficiencies like risk management and nomination committee weaknesses, unqualified management, and regulatory multiplicity in the Nigerian context, especially within the recent 2009–2024 period for longitudinal analysis and 2024 for cross-sectional insights (Osita et al., 2019; Tsamenyi et al., 2007; Ozili, 2020). This research gap limits the ability to develop targeted reforms aligned with Nigeria’s unique cultural, political, and economic realities, driving the need for this research to fill this lacuna with empirical and qualitative insights.
This research is further motivated by the broader implications for stakeholders—shareholders, depositors, regulators, and the Nigerian economy at large. Persistent bank failures and governance lapses erode investor confidence, both domestic and foreign, stifling capital flow and economic growth, while weak accountability and transparency jeopardize financial integrity and public trust (Okoye et al., 2016; Frost et al., 2002). By investigating the effectiveness of corporate governance indices, audit-committee independence (mediated by financial-reporting integrity as perceived by insiders), management qualifications, and regulatory clarity within the 2009–2024 period for RQ1 and 2024 for RQ2–RQ4, this research seeks to provide actionable insights to strengthen governance mechanisms, mitigate default risk, and restore stability. The urgency to align Nigeria’s deposit money banking governance with global best practices, coupled with the potential to inform regulatory reforms and enhance stakeholder confidence, underscores the critical importance of this research (Solomon, 2020; Efunniyi et al., 2024; Nwoke et al., 2023).
This research is structured as follows: Section 2 will review the relevant literature on corporate governance and board accountability, emphasizing accountability and transparency in the Nigerian deposit money banking sector. Section 3 will provide details on the proposed methodology for this research, including examples of the survey questions. Section 4 will provide the method of data analysis. Section 5 will provide the current state of corporate governance, specifically accountability and transparency in Nigerian deposit money banks.
